Glorious spirit of Ukraine shines and lives forever.

Blessed by Fortune brotherhood will stand up together.

Like the dew before the sun enemies will fade,

We will further rule and prosper in our promised land.

 

We will lay our soul and body for the cherished freedom.

Cossack blood will raise the nation of the joyous people.

For the liberty the folk strives ardently from San to Don,

And will let no alien power in our common home.

 

Aged Dnieper and Black Sea arm in arm rejoice,

And Ukraine will see daylight and live by Fortune's choice.

We will lay our soul and body for the cherished freedom.

Cossack blood will raise the nation of the joyous people.

 

Passion and hard-working hands prove bright future true.

Song of freedom, loud and clear, guides us all way through.

Over mountains and steppes it flows, over ages told.

Valorous Ukraine stands strong in a thriving world.

 

We will lay our soul and body for the cherished freedom.

Cossack blood will raise the nation of the joyous people.
